# MIT-Wind-Quantitative

Also incomplete, there is an error with the column name joining the numbers of one value that I don't know how to resolve. The data covers all of March 2010's anemometer-measured wind speeds at every minute at one of MIT's campus locations ('Sailing Pavilion'). I chose the dataset in part because it's unique (wind is a breath of fresh air), but also that noting wind behavior is pivotal for meteorologists and climate scientists. What I found from the data is unclear because of the glitch that won't allow the data to be interpreted, though I can confidently say that the wind speed measured didn't exceed 24 meters per second at any minute
